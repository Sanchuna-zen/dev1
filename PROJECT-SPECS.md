## **Product Concept** 

A real-time offline shop inventory aggregation platform for Chennai, enabling users to search, filter, and compare products across multiple local shops. Shop owners can self-enroll, update inventory, and use the platform for advertising and customer acquisition. The platform will feature robust sorting/filtering, hybrid manual/digital inventory update options, and strong onboarding/support for shop owners. The rollout will be incremental and pilot-driven, with ongoing monitoring and adaptation based on local sentiment and operational feasibility.
