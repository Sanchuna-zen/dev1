## **Product Concept** 

A peer-to-peer skill bartering platform where users exchange micro-skills using a credit system, with a strong focus on inclusivity, gamification, and community-building. The platform is designed to be accessible to a wide range of users, including older adults, low-tech users, and non-native speakers, and will pilot advanced features in a measured, data-driven way to validate engagement and inclusivity.
